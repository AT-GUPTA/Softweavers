Standard deviation definition:
-   A measure of dispersion in a frequency distribution, equal to the square root of the mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic mean of the distribution.
<source: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/standard-deviation>

-   A parameter that indicates the way in which a probability function or a probability density function is centered around its mean and that is equal to the square root of the moment in which the deviation from the mean is squared

-   Low standard deviation means data are clustered around the mean, and high standard deviation indicates data are more spread out.

Formulas used to calculate standard deviation:
-   Population standard deviation:
        σ = ( 1 / N ∑_(i=1)^N ( x_i - μ )^2 )^( 1/2 )

-   Sample standard deviation:
        s = ( 1 / (n - 1) ∑_(i=1)^n ( x_i - x ̅ )^2 )^( 1/2 )

N:          Total number of population values
n:          Total number of sample values
∑_(i=1)^N:  The sum from 1 to N
x_i:        Value at the ith position
μ:          Population mean
x ̅:         Sample mean

-   Population mean:
        μ = ∑_(i=1)^N x_i / N

-   Sample mean:
        x ̅ = ∑_(i=1)^n x_i / n
