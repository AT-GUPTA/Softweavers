Standard deviation definition:
-   A measure of dispersion in a frequency distribution, equal to the square root of the mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic mean of the distribution.
<source: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/standard-deviation>

-   A parameter that indicates the way in which a probability function or a probability density function is centered around its mean and that is equal to the square root of the moment in which the deviation from the mean is squared
<source: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/standard%20deviation>

-   Low standard deviation means data are clustered around the mean, and high standard deviation indicates data are more spread out.

Formulas used to calculate standard deviation:
-   Population standard deviation:
        σ = ( 1 / N ∑_(i=1)^N ( x_i - μ )^2 )^( 1/2 )

-   Sample standard deviation:
        s = ( 1 / (n - 1) ∑_(i=1)^n ( x_i - x ̅ )^2 )^( 1/2 )

N:          Total number of population values
n:          Total number of sample values
∑_(i=1)^N:  The sum from 1 to N
x_i:        Value at the ith position
μ:          Population mean
x ̅:         Sample mean

-   Population mean:
        μ = ∑_(i=1)^N x_i / N

-   Sample mean:
        x ̅ = ∑_(i=1)^n x_i / n

arccos(x)

Introduction

Motivation
It is used to measure an unknown angle when the length of 2 sides of a right-triangle are known.

Definition
Arcos(x) is the inverse trigonometric function of cos when -1 x1 such that when cos(y) = x, arccos(x) = y.
<source: https://www.rapidtables.com/math/trigonometry/arccos.html>

Cos(x)
The ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse of a right-triangle. It is one of the basic trigonometric functions. Cos() is the horizontal coordinate (x-value) of the arc endpoint of the unit circle.

Unit Circle
A circle with radius = 1 where we can directly measure cos.

Power Functions & Exponential Functions 

Introduction

Both power function and exponential function stem from the notion of exponentiation. They both have a base and an exponent, but the difference is where a variable is placed. A power function has a variable as its base whereas an exponential function has a variable as its exponent. But what happens if you mix them together?

Definition

Power function
f(x) = axb 
where x is a real variable and a and b are real numbers and a is known as coefficient.

Exponential function
f(x) = abx 
where x is a real variable and a and b are real numbers and a is known as coefficient. 

f(x, y) = xy is a mix of a power function and an exponential function. Just like an exponential function, y can be any real number. However, this function does not have any solution when x < 0.
Therefore, f(x, y) = xy where x is a positive real variable and y is a real variable.

Γ(α)
The Gamma function

Definition
The gamma function Gamma(n) is defined to be an extension of the factorial to complex and real number arguments. 
It is related to the factorial by Gamma(n)=(n-1)! and is now universally used instead of Gauss's simpler Pi(n)=n!.
It is analytic everywhere except at z=0, -1, -2, ..., and the residue at z=-k is Res_(z=-k)Gamma(z)=((-1)^k)/(k!). 	
There are no points z at which Gamma(z)=0

The gamma function can be defined as a definite integral for R[z]>0 (Euler's integral form)

Gamma(z)=int_0^inftyt^(z-1)e^(-t)dt	
	=2int_0^inftye^(-t^2)t^(2z-1)dt,	
or
Gamma(z)=int_0^1[ln(1/t)]^(z-1)dt.

Some Properties of Gamma function
- Γ(z) is defined and analytic in the region  Re(z)>0
- Γ(n+1)=n!, for integer  n≥0
- Γ(z+1)=zΓ(z) (function equation)
This property and Property 2 characterize the factorial function. Thus, Γ(z) generalizes n! to complex numbers z
- Γ(α) can be analytically continued to be meromorphic on the entire plane with simple poles at 0, −1, −2 .... The residues are Res(Γ,−m)=((−1)^m)/m!
- Γ(α + 1) = αΓ(α) and Γ(1/2) = √π
