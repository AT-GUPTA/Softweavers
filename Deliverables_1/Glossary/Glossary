Accuracy                    The degree of how close a calculated or measured value is to the actual value. (e.g. 3.1416 is more accurate than 3.14 when calculating pi)
Basic Arithmetics           The fundamental mathematical operations used to manipulate and compute numerical values - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Calculation History         A record of the previous calculations performed by the user, which can be displayed and recalled for reference or correction purposes.
Function                    A relationship or expression involving one or more variables.
Input Field                 The space to enter numerical values and perform calculations using buttons or a keyboard.
Logarithmic Function        A logarithm is the inverse function of exponentiation that measures the power to which a given base must be raised to produce a given value.
Maclauren Series Expansion  A representation of a function as an infinite sum of polynomial terms centered at zero, used to approximate the value of the function for a given input within a certain range of accuracy.
Mathematical Expression     A combination of numbers, symbols, and operators that can be evaluated or simplified using mathematical rules and operations.
Mathematical Symbol         A figure or a combination of figures that is used to represent a mathematical object, an action on mathematical objects, a relation between mathematical objects, or for structuring the other symbols that occur in a formula.
Power Function              A one-term function with a variable as its base that is raised to a fixed real number.
Precision                   The degree of exactness of a calculated or a measured value. (e.g. 4.53678 is as precise as 5.95857)
Scientific Calculator       A calculator that can compute more than basic algebraic functions. The functions include transcendental functions.
Scientific Notation         A floating-point representation system where a number is represented as the product of a number between one and ten and the appropriate power of ten.
Subordinate function        A function that supports one or more of the other functions. (e.g. factorial function or square root function).
Syntax                      A set of rules that govern the order and arrangement of mathematical symbols, in order to create a correct mathematical expression.
Tooltip                     A GUI element that provides additional information about a particular item or feature when the user hovers their cursor over it.
Transcendental function     A function that does not satisfy any single-variable polynomial equation whose coefficients are themselves roots of polynomials.
