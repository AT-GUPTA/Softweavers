Items to be considered throughout:
a. Are the questions context-free?
b. Is there any response with a bias?
c. Are there any overlapping backgrounds?

Background
5 our of 7 interviewees are students, majority being CS or Math students. For persona creation, consider merging CS students and Math students.

Level of education (Tendency may be result of convenience sampling)
All university students or graduates in Computer or Math related fields. The sampling pool is not randomized enough to deduce any correlation between the level of education and the use of scientific calculator.

Use of calculator
Most interviewees use calculator either on their mobile device or on a computer.

Frequency of usage
All the answers were 'everyday' or 'frequently'. As users are exposed to the calculator on a regular basis, facilitating features would be apealing to the potential users.

Context of usage
Mainly academic purposes, some use it in personal or professional context. The main clientele of the project could be students/teachers.

Type of Mathematical calculations
There is no clear tendancy on this as each interviewee has different need.

Device used / preferred software
There is a tendancy to use a physical calculator or a basic phone calculator for simple arithmatic calculations. But when it comes to more complex calculations, people tend to use calculation softwares on the computer. Due to a few ommission of the question in a few interviews, it was difficult to find a tendancy, but Maple is the most mentionned software.

Importance of user interface/design
Interviewees tend to give less to no importance to the UI or design. However, simple and easy to use would be a preferred design.

Undo/edit function
Most of interviewees answered it would be useful. Something to consider adding.

History of previous calculations
Many of interviewees showed high interest to this feature. It could be the marketing point.
