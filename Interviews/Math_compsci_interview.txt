# Introductions
2.	Could you briefly tell me about your background and yourself?

Math and Computer science student who depends heavily on calculator. Moved here 4 years ago from Syria and really enjoys the time she’s spend here. Lives with her aunt who works at a data science company, DRW that she hopes to be a part of when she graduates.


2b. Could you describe your current occupation? 

T.A for Concordia. Teaches Algorithms and Java (1 & 2).


3.	Could you tell me about your educational profile?

Undergrad at Concordia. Planning on doing a master’s in mathematics.


4.	How do you solve calculations in your daily life?

Maple, mathematic.


4b. What kind of mathematical calculations do you perform?

Derivates or integration mostly but also does some logarithmic calculations.


5b.  How often do you use a calculator?

Everyday.


5.	Under which context do you use a calculator? (eg. work, academic, personal)

Academic.


6.	 What kind of devices do you use to perform the calculations?

Laptop.


7b. Do you prefer any specific software’s to do these calculations on?

Maple, mathematic, python.


7.	How important is the user interface and design of a calculator to you? 

Not important, more about the functionality.


8.	Would you consider the undo/edit function important in a calculator?

Yes, would be nice.


9.	How useful would you find a calculator that provides history of previous calculations?

Not the most important, would be a nice feature.


# Scientific Calculator
As its name suggests, the scientific calculator is designed for performing scientific calculations. This type of calculator usually has more buttons than a standard calculator, as it needs to be able to perform trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponential operations (transcendental functions).

10.	How would you describe your experience with a scientific calculator if you have any?

Easy to work with. Could be frustrating when you get an error.


11.	 Do you usually need an explanation for the functions on a scientific calculator? 
    (If the person does not use a scientific calculator, ask them if they will prefer to see such explanations if using one)

For some at first yes. imagines for those who don’t know the functions it would be helpful, or even has a reminder, just as long has it doesn’t get in the way.


12.	 What are the features that you use the most in a scientific calculator?
    (If the person does not use a scientific calculator, ask them what feature of a scientific calculator they would find most useful)

Log and trigonometric functions.


13.	 What is your go-to function on a calculator? Would you prefer a hotkey mapped for this function?

No, prefers less buttons. Everything she needs is already mapped to a button.


14.	 Would you prefer the ability to navigate through the steps of the calculation?

No, just wants the answer. Does usually have a problem with how you get to them.


15.	 How important is accuracy in decimal places of your calculations.

It does matter greatly. Wishes to be able to set and adjust the scale.


16.	 Would you need a calculator that can handle complex numbers?

Yes, would be nice. 


# Pain Points
17.	 What are the most frustrating things about your calculator?

Display is limited. The screen is small. When there is an error, it just displays that there is a error and not where the error is.


18.	 Does the scientific calculator meet your needs? If not, what do you think does it lack?

It does. For the thing she’s doing now.


# Winding up
19.	 If you could add any ability, which one would you add in a scientific calculator?

Finding all possible roots.


20.	 Is there anything else that you would like to share about your views/use of a calculator?

Complex numbers.
Instead of just saying ERROR, show where the error is.
