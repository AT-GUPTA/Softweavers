Usually by using google calculator or the built-in calculator app on my laptop or by use of a physical calculator.

4b. What kind of mathematical calculations do you perform?
Simple arithmetic calculations for personal as well as educational purposes (assignments)

# General Calculator
(Not necessary if the interviewee answered calculator in #4. Skip to 5b.) 
5. Do you use a calculator? Yes

5b. How often do you use a calculator?
Not too often (3-4 times a week)

7. What kind of devices do you use to perform the calculations? 
Phone or computer

(If the interviewee answered computer or phone) 
7b. Do you prefer any specific software to do these calculations on? 
Phone as I can use it more easily and everywhere. No particular software.

8. How important is the user interface and design of a calculator to you? 
As long as you can do simple and complex calculations, UI does not really matter.

// #9-10 are yes/no questions, but these will give us ideas how pertinent it would be to add these functions.

// Overlaps with #11. Suggest removing this question. 
9. Do you need to be able to save and recall previous calculations or export them for later?
No

10. Would you consider the undo/edit function important in a calculator?
No

11. How usefull would you find a calculator that provides history of previous calculations?
Not too useful as my calculations would be different everytime

# Scientific Calculator
As its name suggests, the scientific calculator is designed for performing scientific calculations. This type of calculator usually has more buttons than a standard calculator, as it needs to be able to perform trigonometric functions, logarithms and exponential operations (transcendental functions).

<<FACT= explain briefly what a scientific calc is>>

12. How would you describe your experience with a scientific calculator, if you have any?
I have used it in the past and it was very useful during my Math classes.

13. Do you usually need an explanation for the functions on a scientific calculator? 
Sometimes (if it is a new function).
(If the person does not use a scientific calcualtor, ask them if they will prefer to see such explanations if using one)

14. What are the features that you use the most in a scientific calculator?
(If the person does not user a scientific calculator, ask them what feature of a scientific calculator would they find most useful)
Basic Math operations, trigonometry function and Power function

15. What is your goto function on a calculator? Would you prefer a hotkey mapped for this function?
No go-to function or hotkey.

16. Would you prefer the ability to navigate through the steps of the calculation?
Yes, it could be useful sometimes.

17. How important is accuracy in decimal places of your calculations.
I usually want a maximum of 5 decimal places.

18. Would you need a calculator that can handle complex numbers?
No

# Pain Points
19. What are the most frustrating things about your calculator?
The lack of insertion inbetween expressions, instead it always replaces the character

20. Does the scientific calculator meet your needs? If not, what do you think does it lack?
Yes.

# Winding up
21. If you could add any ability, which one would you add in a scientific calculator?
Nothing comes to mind as I am already comfortable with the functions in a scientific calculator.

22. Is there anything else that you would like to share about your views/use of a calculator?
No.
// Conclude the interview by thanking the interviewee
