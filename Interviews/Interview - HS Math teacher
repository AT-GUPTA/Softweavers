// Transition question towards calculator.
4. How do you solve calculations in your daily life?
I guess I use calculator?
4b. What kind of mathematical calculations do you perform?

(Not necessary if the interviewee answered calculator in #4. Skip to 5b.) 5. Do you use a calculator?
5b. How often do you use a calculator?
Almost everyday.
6. Under which context do you use a calculator? (eg. work, academic, personal)

10. Would you consider the undo/edit function important in a calculator? Yes

11. How usefull would you find a calculator that provides history of previous calculations?
I think it would be useful.

# Scientific Calculator
As its name suggests, the scientific calculator is designed for performing scientific calculations. This type of calculator usually has more buttons than a standard calculator, as it needs to be able to perform trigonometric functions, logarithms and exponential operations (transcendental functions).

<<FACT= explain briefly what a scientific calc is>>

12. How would you describe your experience with a scientific calculator, if you have any?
That is what I use daily basis. I wouldn't be able to do my job without one.

13. Do you usually need an explanation for the functions on a scientific calculator? Not so much now.
    (If the person does not use a scientific calcualtor, ask them if they will prefer to see such explanations if using one)

14. What are the features that you use the most in a scientific calculator? Besides basic arithmatic functions, I would say exponent function.
    (If the person does not user a scientific calculator, ask them what feature of a scientific calculator would they find most useful)

15. What is your goto function on a calculator? I don't really have one. 
Would you prefer a hotkey mapped for this function? What I use are already there as hotkey.

16. Would you prefer the ability to navigate through the steps of the calculation? It would be useful.

17. How important is accuracy in decimal places of your calculations. I don't really care much about decimal places.

18. Would you need a calculator that can handle complex numbers? No

# Pain Points
19. What are the most frustrating things about your calculator?
I guess I get frustrated when I enter wrong number but can't go back to fix it.

20. Does the scientific calculator meet your needs? Yes If not, what do you think does it lack?

# Winding up
21. If you could add any ability, which one would you add in a scientific calculator?
Autocorrection on the parenthesis closure.

22. Is there anything else that you would like to share about your views/use of a calculator?
No
