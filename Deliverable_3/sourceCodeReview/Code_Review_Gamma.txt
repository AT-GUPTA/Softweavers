CODE CHECKS
Q : Are the comments helpful?
A : There are no comments explaining the logic of the function. Since the function is not a straightforward 
    read, it could be helpful to have an explanation of the different parts. Also, multiline comments should 
    be used to describe the function and its parameter & return value.

Q : Is there domain validation and error handling for incorrect input?
A : Yes. The function checks for zero-negative inputs and throws an appropriate exception.

Q : Does it have the correct types (BigDecimal and BigInteger) for parameters and return type?
A : Yes.

Q : Are variables descriptively named and follow naming conventions?
A : No. Some of the variables are named using single letters, which, makes it hard to understand the 
    purpose of the variable.

Q : Is the code readable and easy to understand or follow?
A : In general, yes. However, some sections could be improved.
Example: In FunctionImpl.java, line 71, there are multiple adds and divide within the same line. This line 
         could be decomposed in 3 distinct operations,making the code easier to understand.

Q : Is it redundant? 
A : No.

Q : Is the code overcomplicated or too clever?
A : No. 

Q : Is it possible to reduce the complexity of the code?
A : Not easily.

Q : Does the method use any prebuilt functions?
A : Yes, the function uses Math.Pow. It should be replaced with the in-house pow function.

Extra Notes (optional): 

Not too sure why, at line 69, the number "0.99999999999980993" was used to initialize a BigDecimal. This could put in a constant.

Response from Khavish:

Comment: "There are no comments explaining the logic of the function. Since the function is not a straightforward read, it could be helpful to have an explanation of the different parts. Also, multiline comments should be used to describe the function and its parameter & return value."
Response: The issue has been addressed and comments concerning the code are now available.

Comment: "Yes, the function uses Math.Pow. It should be replaced with the in-house pow function."
Response: The issue has been addressed and the in-house built power function is now used.

Comment: "Not too sure why, at line 69, the number "0.99999999999980993" was used to initialize a BigDecimal. This could put in a constant."
Response: The decision to set an initial value for the Lanczos approximation to 0.99999999999980993 is critical as it helps to improve the convergence of the approximation.
