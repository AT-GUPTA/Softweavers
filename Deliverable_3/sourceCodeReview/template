NOTES FOR REPORT WRITING 
We are making sure the code is logically correct before peer code review.
I think there was a bit of over-the-shoulder review for the parser - Alexander went over the code and Atul was reviewing during a meeting? (If i remember correctly)
Need to know if there was code review during development of parser, backend, front end.
Review for functions is following Email-pass-around process - not sure if its pre check-in or post check-in
